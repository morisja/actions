# Actions

Generate json configuration for the excellent Actions app 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions-http-request-sender/id1400036021

## My use case

I run a home built sonos service I'm building hardware for. This app permits me to control and test while the hardware is being built.

## Ideas for the app

- Permit a URL to be set in the app which rereads the specification file  (vs import via copy paste )
  
  - I would teach my app server to expose the config file, then I could just refresh as new playlists are added

- Support simple icon layout instead of lists of pure text, e.g:

```
[ action1  action2  action3 ]
[     action4    action5    ]
[ action6  action7  action8 ]
```

- Action icons should be pure unicode
